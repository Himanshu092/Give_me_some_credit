# Kaggle-Give_me_some-_credit-
Defaulter prediction
Worked on the Give_me_some_credit dataset from Kaggle.Training set included 1,50,000 rows,created a nested cross validation from the same in the ratio of 2:1(train:test).Cleaned dataset and subsituted appropiate values in place of NA's.Also created a heat map for feature correlation.Applied 5 algorithms for classifications namely Logistic regression,Naive Bayes,Random forest,Gradient Boosting Machine and XGBoost.Achieved a recall AUC of .695.On course to fine tune models and improving accuracy.Running the code will requrire prerequisite libraries,which can be downloaded from CRAN repositry.
