## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

credit_dat<-read.csv("Give_Me_Some_Credit.csv")
set.seed(101)
train<-sample(nrow(credit_dat),(2/3)*nrow(credit_dat))
credit_train<-credit_dat[train,]
Defaulter<-ifelse(credit_train$SeriousDlqin2yrs==0,"N","Y")
credit_train<-cbind.data.frame(credit_train,Defaulter)



#Data Prep
#Calculating Mean(MonthlyIncome) according to agebins and replacing NA's with correponding values

age_Income<-function(train_data,limit,x=20)
{
  temp_mean<-rep(0,length = limit/10)
  
  for(i in 1:(limit/10))
   { temp_mean[i]<-mean(train_data[which((train_data$      age 
     %in% 
     c(x:x+10))),"MonthlyIncome"],na.rm=TRUE)
     print(temp_mean)
     
     x=x+10
   }
}

#Calling function
age_Income(credit_train,70)
#Limit is 70 as we want to compute Income mean's upto 90 yrs age bin




#Unexpectedly RevolvingUtilizationofUnsecuredcreditlines is >1 in some of the rows which can be an anamoly
credit_train<-credit_train[-which(credit_train$RevolvingUtilizationOfUnsecuredLines>1),]
#Removing NA's from MonthlyIncome
credit_train<-credit_train[-which(is.na(credit_train$MonthlyIncome)),]
#Removing NA's from NumberOfDependents
credit_train<-credit_train[-which(is.na(credit_train$NumberOfDependents)),]



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
